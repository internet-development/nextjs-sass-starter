# NEXTJS-SASS-STARTER

**[Live Demo](https://wireframes.internet.dev)**

Our extensive experience in building numerous websites has led us to create this template repository as an efficient starting point. If you're keen on developing websites alongside the [Internet Development Studio Company](https://internet.dev), we highly recommend utilizing this template as your foundation.

Why would I use this?

- **Jumpstart Your Project** → Leverage the power of TypeScript, SASS, and NextJS to quickly get your project off the ground.
- **Template Efficiency** → Streamline your development process by using a pre-configured template.
- **Speed and Simplicity** → Ideal for rapid website creation without compromising on quality.
- **Learning Opportunity** → If you're delving into web development, perhaps under the guidance of [@wwwjim](https://x.com/wwwjim), this template is a perfect starting point. Enhance your learning experience by exploring the [issues section](https://github.com/internet-development/nextjs-sass-starter/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3ADocumentation), which includes helpful documentation.

### Setup (MacOS)

Start by cloning the repository, or by clicking on **Use this template** above.

You will have wanted to setup your development environment by following steps [here](https://github.com/internet-development/nextjs-sass-starter/issues/3).

Then run the server

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Go to `http://localhost:10000` in your browser of choice.

Enjoy! The template uses `10000` as our `port` for more compatibility with [Render.com](https://render.com)

### Scripts (Optional)

If you need to run node script without running the server, use this example to get started

```sh
npm run script example
```
